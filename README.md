# SpatialForge

SpatialForge is a standalone spatial mapping and localization engine. It will
turn calibrated indoor scans into metric, semantic, localizable maps while
remaining independent of navigation products such as VoiceGIS.

This repository currently implements three narrow foundations:

- a versioned, folder-backed `ScanSession` (`.vgsession`) contract;
- validation for calibration, timestamps, file references, depth scale, IMU
  samples, and rigid camera poses;
- deterministic offline replay around RGB observations;
- an extracted TUM RGB-D folder importer with known-pose support; and
- calibrated, known-pose RGB-D back-projection to a deterministic colored PLY.

RGB-D fusion, meshing, SLAM, map packages, mobile capture, and the visual
inspector are deliberately not implemented yet.

## Set up

Python 3.11 or newer is required.

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -e .
```

## Validate and replay a session

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m spatialforge scan validate `
  tests/fixtures/minimal.vgsession
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m spatialforge scan replay `
  tests/fixtures/minimal.vgsession
```

Import the committed tiny TUM-layout fixture:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m spatialforge scan import-tum `
  tests/fixtures/tum/rgbd_dataset_freiburg1_tiny `
  outputs/tum-tiny.vgsession
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m spatialforge scan validate `
  outputs/tum-tiny.vgsession
```

## Build a known-pose point cloud

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m spatialforge reconstruct point-cloud `
  tests/fixtures/minimal.vgsession `
  outputs/minimal.ply
```

Run the complete test suite:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

The format and coordinate conventions are documented in
[`docs/scan-session-v0.md`](docs/scan-session-v0.md). TUM-specific conversion
rules are in [`docs/tum-import.md`](docs/tum-import.md), and the current
reconstruction boundary is in
[`docs/known-pose-point-cloud.md`](docs/known-pose-point-cloud.md).
