# SpatialForge roadmap

This is the current implementation status against the original architecture.
The project is intentionally advancing through small, testable checkpoints.

## Working now

- `ScanSession v0.1` folder contract with calibrated RGB, depth, IMU, and known
  pose streams.
- Strict validation of timestamps, paths, depth scale, camera models, rigid
  transforms, and coordinate conventions.
- Deterministic replay, exact timestamp association, and SHA-256 input digests.
- Deterministic TUM RGB-D folder import with known-pose conversion.
- Known-pose RGB-D back-projection to colored ASCII PLY.
- Fixed-bounds projective TSDF integration with deterministic diagnostics.
- TSDF exact-zero and sign-changing-edge extraction to XYZ surface-point PLY.
- Fully observed TSDF-cell extraction to a deterministic, indexed triangle PLY
  using a fixed six-tetrahedron reference split.
- CLI error handling, overwrite protection, synthetic fixtures, documentation,
  and automated numerical regression tests.

## Remaining in known-pose reconstruction

These complete the architecture's first geometric proof before pose estimation
or SLAM:

1. automatic but bounded volume selection;
2. sparse or optimized TSDF fusion suitable for full sequences;
3. full TUM/ARKitScenes sample runs and geometry accuracy reports;
4. production mesh refinement: exact-zero cells, normals, connected-component
   and quality validation, and an optimized extraction backend;
5. gravity/floor alignment, floor and wall candidates, and openings; and
6. a top-down/3D Inspector view.

## Later major milestones

1. Define and export `SpatialMapPackage`, including quality, uncertainty, and
   provenance.
2. Visual keyframes, features, matching, robust pose estimation, and trajectory
   evaluation against known poses.
3. IMU preintegration, visual-inertial optimization, factor graph, loop
   closure, and place recognition.
4. Structural mapping: floors, walls, openings, rooms, corridors, walkable
   regions, and coverage.
5. Semantic mapping: objects, doors, stairs, lifts, signs, OCR, confidence, and
   multi-view provenance.
6. Visitor localization: retrieval, local matching, 2D/3D correspondences,
   PnP, pose verification, tracking, and relocalization.
7. Multi-session and multi-floor alignment, connector handling, and change
   detection.
8. Mobile scan capture, active coverage guidance, benchmarks, and the eventual
   VoiceGIS import adapter.

SLAM, semantics, and localization should not begin until the known-pose
reconstruction path is numerically and visually trustworthy.

## How to verify progress

Run:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -e .
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

The suite must finish with `OK`.

Then follow the point-cloud, TSDF, surface-point, and triangle-mesh commands in
the repository README. Their deterministic hashes, fusion weights, signed
values, exact coordinates, topology, winding, and boundary counts provide
checks independent of visual appearance.
